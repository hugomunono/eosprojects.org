      <h3>Who maintains this site?</h3>

        <p>This website was created and is maintained by <a href="https://tokenika.io/" target="_blank">Tokenika</a>. This website was designed in such a way that community is able to add/edit all entries about projects:
            <ul>
                <li>everyone can add a new project as a draft</li>
                <li>author of draft and team members of a project can edit it</li>
                <li>moderators can edit/publish all project</li>
            </ul>

            We believe, that it is in best interest of every active EOS community member, to keep ledger of all projects up to date.

        </p>

      <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
        <p><a href="{{ PROJECT_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL }}" target="_blank">This project is open-source</a>, what means that everyone can contribute, by creating a pull request. Even if you are not a programmer, you can still help by adding information about new projects, which should be listed on {{ SITE_TITLE }} or you can help by creating <a href="{% url 'grids' %}">Comparision Grids</a>.</p>

      <h3>What are grids?</h3>

      <p><a href="/grids/">Grids</a> let you compare {{ FRAMEWORK_NAME }} projects to each other. A grid comes with a number of default items compared, but you can add more features in order to get a more specific comparison.</p>
      <p>For now, we are trying out {{ SITE_TITLE }} without the traditional tagging system, because we think that
          grids give us a lot more specificity.
      </p>

      <h3>What are categories?</h3>

      <p>Categories are broad groups of {{ FRAMEWORK_NAME }} projects into something more granular than Grids. A project can only have one category. Changing then requires backend work, and is not done lightly. This is intentional, done in order to make searching easier.</p>
